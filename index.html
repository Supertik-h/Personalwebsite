          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! I'm a passionate <b>IT</b> enthusiast currently pursuing my journey in the world of technology. At 20 years old, I’m deeply interested in software development, cybersecurity, and data analysis. My journey began a few years ago with a curiosity about how things work behind the scenes, which quickly turned into a full-blown passion.

            I have hands-on experience with various programming languages like <u>Python, Java, and JavaScript</u>, and I enjoy building applications that solve real-world problems. Lately, I've been diving deeper into cybersecurity, fascinated by the challenge of protecting systems and data in an increasingly digital world.
            
            When I'm not coding or exploring new technologies, you can find me tinkering with hardware projects or playing video games. I'm always eager to learn new skills, take on challenges, and collaborate on exciting projects.
            
            <i>Let's connect and create something awesome together!</i>

                  I’m a passionate sports enthusiast with a deep love for both playing and following a wide range of sports. Whether it’s on the field, court, or in the gym, you’ll often find me pushing my limits and striving to improve every day.

                  I’ve been involved in sports since I was a kid, and over the years, I’ve developed a strong passion for disciplines like football, basketball, and track and field. Competing has taught me the importance of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance—values I carry with me both on and off the field.

                <p>
                  Music has always been at the heart of who I am. As someone deeply passionate about melodies and rhythms, I find joy in both creating and experiencing music. Whether it’s playing an instrument, producing beats, or simply losing myself in a favorite song, music is my constant companion.

                  Over the years, I’ve explored various genres, from classical to electronic, and I’m always eager to discover new sounds. Playing the guitar and piano has allowed me to express myself creatively, while experimenting with digital music production has opened up a world of possibilities for crafting original tracks.

                  From classic literature to contemporary fiction, and from thought-provoking non-fiction to thrilling mysteries, I enjoy exploring a wide range of genres. Each book I read not only offers an escape but also teaches me something new about humanity, history, or the complexities of life.
